Tableau Dashboard with King County State's Data:

This project includes a Tableau dashboard created using HouseData.xlsx and dashboard is used to visualize HouseData.xlsx stay data.
In this project, I made a few visualizations based on a certain region, based on the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, 
general appearance and condition of the houses sold in that region.
These visualizations can also change depending on the filters.
